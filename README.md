CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Module three changes over from static html data to a dynamic JSON code. This is better for scalability as well as reusability. The primary code for the website is now much shorter than it would have been with static html. The dynamic JSON allows for references to be called within the main function in order to implement the code as easily as possible. This makes it so that one simple change can update the website rather than changing multiple lines of code on every page. After this changes there will be hundreds of lines of code total that are removed from the entire website project and instead referenced within the code and implemented from the same location. This will increase efficiency, especially as the project grows larger.
