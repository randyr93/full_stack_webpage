CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

This project uses multiple kinds of front end design. There are aspects that are Express HTML, Javascript and a Single-page application for use on the backend. There are many similarities as well as differences between the verious kinds of software used here. There is a NoSQL database that is used to store data for the web page. This kind of database is used to increase response times as well as work better with the code that was used. There is JSON used in this project as well as the Javascript that was mentioned. JSON allows for the manipulation of data that is needed to provide the user with a good web page experience. There were a few pages that were refactored to make the web page more user friendly. The individual pages were changed to allow easier changes as well as better manipulation of the code.

This web page was tested using endpoints and the PostMan applicaiton. Postman allows us to verify that the endpoints are working properly and allowing the user to access information that they should be able to. This is also essential to the testing of security, ensuring that the user isn't able to access information that is off limits to them.

This project gave me a better understanding of what goes into a web page as well as the various ways of creating them. There are a lot of different ways to structure a website and they each have their own pros and cons. I am excited to continue working with this web page to gain a better understanding of what it can do.
